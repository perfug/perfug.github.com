Today's average website is 62% pure image data. We use images to convey emotion, elicit an action or simply to amuse our peers. They show holiday photos, pie charts or animated cats.  

To the unitiated, nothing much has changed since the JPEG file format was standardized in 1992 and GIFs became capable of showing multiple frames of cat mischief.

But under the hood, the complex realm of raster and vector images is ever changing: new encoders use cues from the fields of computer vision and machine learning to optimize image data, old formats learn new tricks and completely new image formats try to take the stage.

To deliver a great user experience, we need to learn to create high performance images and implement an image management strategy: leveraging the ideal image file formats and use advanced techniques to handle the challenges of responsive designs and situational performance. 

High performance images increase the perceived performance of your website, improve the user experience and drive conversions.
