When we think of performance Java isn’t usually up there with the list of languages you’d choose. Ultimately on a CPU we’d start with assembler and C/C++, not Java, then there are GPUs and FPGA cards, still no Java.

The main problems with Java are the way it abstracts the hardware and its very generalised memory management. The result is safe code but not very performant. In fact, in some cases, the now infamous garbage collector can be the death of your application.

With a few small changes some of this can be undone. Without compromising the safety, we can achieve huge improvements in performance. John will talk and demonstrate how to take Java down to raw binary, an order of magnitude smaller and faster, even more in a distributed environment. The solution is already in production, implemented primarily with in-memory data grids, analytics and CEP. John will also cover some of the existing use-cases.

John nous fera l’honneur de présenter en français !
